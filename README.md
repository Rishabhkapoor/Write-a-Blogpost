## Project: Stay in Boston Made Easier with Airbnb

In this project we are going to use the CRISP - DM technique to answer a few questions:
1. What are the best months to find cheap accommodations in Boston?
2. What are the most least expensive neighborhoods and the most expensive neighborhood in Boston?
3. Which are the few best rated accommodations in Boston?
4. What type of accommodation do guests prefer the most?
